# EDA-and-Preprocessing

# OVERVIEW
This project focuses on processing and analyzing a dataset systematically through multiple stages, covering data exploration, cleaning, analysis, encoding, and scaling. Below is an outline of the tasks to be fulfilled.

# 1. Data Exploration
* Objective: Understand the dataset and its features.
# Steps:
1. Explore the data and list the unique values in each feature.
2. Calculate the length (number of unique values) for each feature.
3. Perform statistical analysis to summarize the data (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
4. Rename columns for better clarity and usability.

# 2. Data Cleaning
Objective: Prepare the dataset by removing errors and inconsistencies.
# Steps:
1. Identify missing and inappropriate values:
2. Replace 0 in the age column with NaN.
3. Treat missing values using appropriate strategies:
4. For numerical columns: Replace with mean or median.
5. For categorical columns: Replace with mode.
6. Remove all duplicate rows.
7. Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Interquartile Range).
8. Verify that all columns are cleaned appropriately.

# 3. Data Analysis
Objective: Gain insights and visualize the data.
# Steps:
1. Filter the data:
Select records where age > 40 and salary < 5000.
2. Create visualizations:
Plot a chart between age and salary.
Count the number of people from each place and represent it visually (e.g., bar chart, pie chart).

# 4. Data Encoding
Objective: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations for machine learning compatibility.
# Steps:
1. Apply One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding to convert categorical data.
2. Ensure that all categorical variables are transformed into numerical values.

# 5. Feature Scaling
Objective: Normalize the data for consistent analysis and model training.
# Steps:
1. Perform feature scaling using:
    *. StandardScaler: Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
    *. MinMaxScaler: Scale features to a range (e.g., 0 to 1).
